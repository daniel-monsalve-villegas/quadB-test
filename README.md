- [ ] It has to be a ReactJS application
- [ ] It has to implement the API and not just harcode data from the API
- [ ] It has to have 2 screens at a minimum. One to display a few data and possibly and image(UI is completely up to you)and another screen to show it's summary. The second screen should have a button to book a movie ticket which will open a form with the movie name already present and a few relevant details. (Reload should not happen) (Use local/session storage for storing user details)
