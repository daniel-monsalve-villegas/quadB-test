# Internship Test

## ReactJS Developer Profile Set-2

We would like you to create 2 screen ReactJS application using this **API**: [TvMaze](https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=all)

We need you to create a basic UI to display the show names and a few details about it (you can choose what you want to display along with the show name). Include a button for each of the shows to redirect the user to another screen that shows the summary of the particular show. (Refer to the api structure. You will find a summary section for each show there.). We need you to complete this assignment and upload it to a GitHub Repository marked as Public and email us back the link to the repository (check the contact section for the email address).

- [x] It has to be a ReactJS application
- [x] It has to implement the API and not just harcode data from the API
- [ ] It has to have 2 screens at a minimum. One to display a few data and possibly and image(UI is completely up to you)and another screen to show it's summary. The second screen should have a button to book a movie ticket which will open a form with the movie name already present and a few relevant details. (Reload should not happen) (Use local/session storage for storing user details)
- [ ] A proper UI so that we know you have a good understanding of UI/UX. Doesn't need to have mind blowing animations but just basic HTML and CSS styling that looks good(You may use bootstrap)
- [ ] Please use proper Component file structure.
